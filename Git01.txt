Ans-01 :-  Certainly! In simple terms, Git is like a digital tool that helps software developers work together on a computer program. It keeps track of all the changes they make to the code and allows them to collaborate seamlessly. It's like a super-smart filing system for code, making it easier to work on projects with others and keep everything organized.


Ans-02 :-A Version Control System (VCS) is like a digital time machine for computer files. It helps people who work on the same project keep track of changes to those files. Think of it as a way to save different "snapshots" of your project as you work on it. This allows you to see what was changed, who made those changes, and when they were made.


Ans-03 :-  GitHub is a website where people put their computer code and work together on projects.


Ans-04 :- (1) GitHub
(2) SourceFor
(3) GitLab


Ans-05 :- There are three main types of version control systems:


1. Local Version Control: This is like a personal diary for your files. It keeps track of changes on your own computer.


2. Centralized Version Control: Think of this as a shared library. Everyone accesses and updates the same central repository.


3. Distributed Version Control: It's like making copies of your work. Everyone has their own copy of the entire project, and changes can be shared between copies. Git is a popular example of this type.


Ans-06 :- Git offers benefits like easy collaboration, a detailed version history, secure backups, the ability to work on experimental features without affecting the main project (branching)


Ans-07 :-  A Git repository is like a folder where Git keeps all the files and their change history for a project.


Ans-08 :- For initialization git repository we have to give “git init” command in git command prompt.
