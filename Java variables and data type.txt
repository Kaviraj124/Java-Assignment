Ans–1 Statically typed programming language
        In which programming language we must have to declare which type of data we stored
 in the variables. It's called the Statically typed programming language.
Ex: C, C++, JAVA….
Dynamically  typed programming language
In which programming language we don’t have to declare which type of data in the 
variable we stored in. Those programming language called as Dynamically typed
 programming language
Ex: Javascript, Python….


Ans–2 Variable:-  Variable is a name of memory allocated reserved area. While we compiled the          code the  variable was  stored in a container that's we called as memory allocated 
             variable. 


Ans–3 By using (=) sign we can assign a value to a whatever Variable. Ex:- int a = 50;


Ans–4 Primitive Data type of JAVA :- int, float, boolean, short, long, double, char.


Ans–5  identifiers in JAVA:- Class name, Variable name, constant name, main method.


Ans–6 List of operators in java:- Arithmetic operators, Relational, Logical, Assignment, Unary,   
Bitwise.


Ans–7 Increment Operator :- Which operator increases the value it’s called as increment  
operator.  
Decrement Operator :- which operator decreases the value in java it’s generally called 
as decrement Operator. 
Example :- a=25; a++;
→ In this example a++ will increase the value of a variable a by one. Simply it means   
      a=(25+1)26;
         → a=25; a–;
     In this example a++ will increase the value of a variable a by one. Simply it means
                 a=(25-1)24;
     There are two type in all in increment and decrement operators those are post  
      increment and pre increment Or post decrement and pre decrement.
