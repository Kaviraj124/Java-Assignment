Ans-01 :- Operators which compare some values and give result in boolean type means in true and false or perform certain tasks, it’s simply called as conditional operators in JAVA.


There are 2 operators in java (1) if/else, (2)ternary.


Ans-02 :- There are three types of operators in java which are based on number of operands.
(1) Unary
(2)Binary
(3)Ternary


Ans-03 :- Switch case - We use switch case whenever we have to select one code block and stop the operation when we get the true value of our condition.


Ans-04 :- Priority levels in arithmetic operators in java.
(1)*,/,%
(2)+,-


Ans-05 :- if and else are the conditional statements in JAVA.
The usage of conditional statements in java:- if the developer or user wants to do certain tasks which have conditions of true and false then the usage of conditional statements.
If the condition is true then a certain task will run which is into an if block. If the condition is false then that task will apply whichever in else or in else if block.


Ans-06 :- Syntax of if else statement.
if(condition){
//Block of code || task which apply when condition is true
}
Else{
//Block of code || task which apply when condition is false
}


Ans-07 :- Types of iterative statements.
(1)for
(2)while
(3)do-while


Ans-08 :- Difference between For and  While Loop


                         For loop                                        Do-while loop
→ Execute when condition is checked.                → Execute once if statement is true or false.
→ It may execute zero times.                                → It will be executed at least once.
→ for single statement brackets are not                → Brackets are compulsory.
     compulsory.
Ans-09 :- public class PrintNumbers
{
Public static void main(String[] args)
      {
for(int  i=0;i<10;i++)
{
      System.out.println(i);
}
      }
}
